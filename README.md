## Installation
- Download Boost Library from the [official website](https://www.boost.org/users/download/)
- Extract the library into any directory
- Set the environment variable BOOST_ROOT to the location of Boost

For example:

```
wget "https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.75.0/source/boost_1_75_0.tar.gz" -o "/usr/home/boost_1_75_0.tar.gz"
tar -xzvf /usr/home/boost_1_75_0.tar.gz
export BOOST_ROOT="/usr/home/boost_1_75_0/"
printenv | grep BOOST_ROOT
```

Alternatively, you can add the `boost` library via various `apt` respositorys.

Then clone `dooked` and compile it, as follows:

```
git clone "https://github.com/codingo/dooked.git"
cd dooked
git submodule update --init
cd dooked/CLI11 && git checkout tags/v1.9.1
cd ../
cmake .
make
```

## Requirements
- Boost C++ library
- cmake
- any C++ compiler (supporting C++17) or MSVC(for Windows).

## Usage

For comprehensive help, use `dooked --help`

### History fields

When a previous JSON result is used as input, dooked now preserves DNS records
that are no longer visible in the current run and stores:

- `first-seen`: the first date the DNS record was observed
- `last-seen`: the most recent date the DNS record was observed
- `seen`: how many runs have observed the record

Additional history prompts are available:

- `--fs`: print records first seen in the current run
- `--ls <days>`: print records not seen in the current run and not seen within
  the requested number of days
- `--lsd <MM/DD/YYYY>`: print records not seen in the current run and not seen
  since the requested date
